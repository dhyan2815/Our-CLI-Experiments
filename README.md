## Architecture Highlights

### DESIGN.md System

Inspired by [Google Stitch's design language concept](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-design-md), DESIGN.md files enable brand-consistent UI generation:

> *"A document where an experienced designer explains a brand's visual language to a developer who's seeing it for the first time."*

The system includes 9 standard sections: visual theme, color palette, typography, components, layout, depth, do's/don'ts, responsive behavior, and agent prompts.

### Skill Structure

Each skill follows a consistent pattern:
- `SKILL.md` — Core instructions & workflows
- `references/` — Examples, hooks, templates
- Version tracking for iterations
